# Fireflies-And-Moonshine
A country fried love story.

**Fireflies and Moonshine** is a narrative-driven visual novel set in the Deep South, where a stranded traveler finds himself caught between small-town secrets and an unexpected connection with a charming, buck-toothed redneck girl who's every bit as eccentric as she is unforgettable.

> Developed over the course of a year and a half, this project is the culmination of solo work in both **art** and **programming**—from hand-drawn sprites and UI design to custom scripting, branching dialogue systems, and player-choice logic.

##  A Note from the Creator

This game was a labor of love and a major step in building my skills as a game developer. I made it to learn, grow, and share a story I truly care about. If you give it a play, I’d love to hear what you think.
